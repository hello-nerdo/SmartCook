# SmartCook: The Vision

## Core Vision

SmartCook aims to solve the "what to cook tonight" dilemma by suggesting chef-quality meals from whatever ingredients you have on hand - even sparse or unusual combinations. The app intelligently transforms random fridge contents into inspired, gourmet-level recipes while considering dietary preferences, helping users save money and reduce waste.

# Core Issues

1. People run out of cooking ideas and struggle to create meals from random ingredients in their fridge.
2. Food waste is significant when ingredients go unused and expire.
3. Most recipe apps require shopping for specific ingredients rather than working with what's available.
4. Users have diverse dietary restrictions and preferences to consider.
5. Even experienced home cooks struggle with creative uses for odd ingredient combinations.

## Dual Product Strategy

SmartCook operates with two distinct but complementary products:

1. **Chef-Quality Recipe Recommendation Engine**: An AI-powered system that transforms even sparse or unusual ingredient combinations into delicious, restaurant-worthy meals based on what users have on hand, their preferences, and skill level.

2. **Meal Planning Subscription**: A premium service that provides weekly meal plans, shopping lists, and automated recipe suggestions to minimize waste and simplify shopping, all customized to the user's dietary preferences.

From the casual user's perspective, the app exists to solve the "I have these random ingredients, what can I make?" problem. From the premium subscriber's perspective, SmartCook provides end-to-end meal planning that saves time and reduces waste. The system seamlessly connects these experiences.

# Main Hypothesis

1. AI-powered recipe recommendations can transform limited or unusual ingredient combinations into chef-quality meals.
2. Users frequently face "cooking block" when staring at random ingredients in their fridge.
3. A subscription service can automate the mental load of meal planning and grocery shopping.
4. Personalized suggestions based on ingredient availability will lead to higher user satisfaction.
5. There is an untapped market for intelligent, waste-reducing meal planning that works with what you already have.
